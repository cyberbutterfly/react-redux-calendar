# React Calendar with Events

### Comments
The aim of this exercise is to create a demo Event Calendar application using React & Redux.

### Task
Initially, you should start by rendering a single month view of a calendar for the current month - along the lines of the following illustration:


Once this is rendered, please implement the following:
1. Allow users to add a new 'Event' for a specific date and time. An event should have a name (with a maximum of 20 characters).
2. Display events on the calendar.
3. Allow the user to select a state for the Event when creating it and display it appropriately. Available states should be 'Solo', 'Team' and 'Company'.
4. Properly handle overflow when multiple events appear on the same date.
5. Allow users to edit events â€“ including changing name, date, time and state.
6. Allow users to delete events.

### Installation steps:

1. open terminal in folder

2. install dependencies

`npm install`

3. start application
